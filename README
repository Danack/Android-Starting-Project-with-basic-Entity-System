You need to add the Entity System project - synched separately from github.

1. git pull this repository:https://github.com/adamgit/Entity-System-RDBMS-Beta--Java-
2. Open this workspace in Eclipse (it will have errors, because of the missing sub-project)
3. In Eclipse, do "Import... existing project"
4. Select the "EntitySystemsJava" subfolder that you just pulled in git
5. Wait a few seconds for Eclipse to re-build everything automatically

The compiler errors should all disappear, as it hooks up the two projects...
